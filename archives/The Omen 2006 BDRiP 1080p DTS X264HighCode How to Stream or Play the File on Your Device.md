### What Critics and Audiences Say About The Omen 2006
 
The Omen 2006 received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some praised the film for its faithful adaptation of the original story, its atmospheric cinematography, its effective scares, and its strong performances. Others criticized the film for its lack of originality, its unnecessary violence, its slow pace, and its poor dialogue.
 
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 26% approval rating from critics based on 169 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's consensus reads: "Even with the force of a 'classic' behind it, remake fever can't hold up the hollowness of this style-drenched Omen." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 43 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". On IMDb, the film has a rating of 5.5/10 based on over 58,000 user votes.
 
Some of the positive reviews came from Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times, who gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: "The Omen is a faithful remake of the 1976 film, and that's a relief; it depends on characters and situations and doesn't go berserk with visuals." Another favorable review came from Stephanie Archer of Film Inquiry, who gave the film an A- grade and wrote: "When it comes to The Omen, it feels as though more entertainment is to be had, rather than horror, yet finds its own layer of terror that extends beyond religion."
 
Some of the negative reviews came from Nigel Floyd of Time Out London, who gave the film one out of five stars and wrote: "A disastrously miscast remake of the 1976 horror classic, which retains the apocalyptic themes of David Seltzer's original script but renders them dull and fright-free." Another unfavorable review came from J.R. Jones of Chicago Reader, who wrote: "The central problem is that the film, for all its gothic iconography and moody lighting, is a silly bore. Global warming is scarier."
