Jurassic World: Dominion is the culmination of a saga that began in 1993 with Jurassic Park, the groundbreaking film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the novel by Michael Crichton. The film introduced audiences to the concept of recreating dinosaurs from ancient DNA preserved in amber, and the dangers of playing God with nature. The film was a huge success, both critically and commercially, and spawned two sequels: The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001).
 
In 2015, the franchise was revived with Jurassic World, a soft reboot that featured a new cast of characters and a new theme park built on the same island as the original one. The film followed Owen Grady, a former Navy SEAL who trained velociraptors, and Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager. The film also introduced the Indominus Rex, a hybrid dinosaur created by genetic engineering. The film was another blockbuster hit, and was followed by Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), which dealt with the aftermath of the park's destruction and the rescue of the surviving dinosaurs from a volcanic eruption. The film also revealed that Maisie Lockwood was a clone of Benjamin Lockwood's daughter, and that she freed the dinosaurs into the wild.
 
Jurassic World: Dominion will conclude the story of Owen, Claire and Maisie, as well as bring back the original trio of Alan, Ellie and Ian, who have not appeared together since the first film. The film will also feature more species of dinosaurs than any previous film in the series, some of which have never been seen before on screen. The film will also explore the implications of having dinosaurs coexist with humans in the modern world, and the potential conflicts that may arise from that.
