The Fall of Padme [ edit] Padme's ambition and greed soon lead him to make enemies with other powerful gangsters in the town. He also becomes involved in a love triangle with a woman named Paththini (Mallika Premachandra), who is the wife of his friend Charles (Wilson Gunaratne). Padme's arrogance and cruelty also alienate his loyal associates, such as Rambo and his uncle (Raja Summanapala). Padme's downfall begins when he kills Willie, who was his main rival and also a close friend of Sammy. Sammy vows to take revenge on Padme and joins forces with another gang leader named Soysa (Susil Gunarathna). They plot to assassinate Padme at a party hosted by a politician (Quintus Weerakoon), who is also Padme's patron. However, their plan fails and Padme escapes with minor injuries.

Padme then decides to eliminate Sammy and Soysa once and for all. He hires a group of mercenaries led by Asoka Peiris (Bhadraji Mahinda Jayatilaka), a former army officer who is an expert in explosives.

However, Padme's reign of terror is not over yet. The inspector, who had been investigating Padme's crimes for a long time, finally gets enough evidence to arrest him. He leads a team of policemen to raid Padme's mansion during the party. A fierce gunfight ensues between the police and Padme's men. Padme tries to escape through a secret tunnel, but he is confronted by Rambo, who had survived the bomb blast at Sammy's house. Rambo shoots Padme in the chest, avenging his friends and family. Padme falls to the ground, bleeding profusely. He looks at Rambo with disbelief and asks him why he did it. Rambo replies that he did it for himself, for his friends, and for the country. He then walks away, leaving Padme to die alone.
