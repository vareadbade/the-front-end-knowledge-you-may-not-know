## Step 1: Download the EBOOT.PBP file of Super Mario 64
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the EBOOT.PBP file of Super Mario 64. This is a compressed file that contains the game data and can be run on your PSP. You can find it on CDRomance[^2^], a website that offers free downloads of PSP ISOs, ROMs, and homebrew games.
 
To download the file, go to [this link](https://cdromance.com/psp/super-mario-64-homebrew/) and click on the "Show Download Links" button. You will see several options to download the file from different servers. Choose one that works for you and save the file to your computer.
 
## Step 2: Transfer the EBOOT.PBP file to your PSP
 
The next step is to transfer the EBOOT.PBP file to your PSP. To do this, you need a USB cable and a memory stick with enough space. Connect your PSP to your computer using the USB cable and turn on the USB mode on your PSP. Your computer should recognize your PSP as a removable drive.
 
Open the drive and navigate to the "PSP" folder. Inside this folder, create a new folder called "GAME" if it doesn't exist already. Then, open the "GAME" folder and create another folder with any name you want. This will be the folder where you will store your homebrew games.
