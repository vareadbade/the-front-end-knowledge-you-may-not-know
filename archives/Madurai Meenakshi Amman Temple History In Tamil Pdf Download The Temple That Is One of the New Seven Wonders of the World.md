According to tradition, more than 3500 years ago the god Indra installed a small tower over a naturally formed stone as a sign of devotion to Shiva, one of the primary deities in the vast Hindu pantheon[^1^]. Other gods followed Indraâs lead and began to worship there. Soon a human devotee witnessed the miraculous scene of gods worshipping at the lingam and notified the local king, Kulashekhara Pandya, who built a temple at the site[^2^].

The story of the figure of Meenakshi is also legendary. It describes a Pandya king, Malayadhvaja, who hoped for a son and heir. He carefully performed a fire ceremony requesting that the gods fulfill this wish. Instead, he was granted a daughter, Meenakshi, who was born with three breasts[^2^]. The gods told the king not to worry, but to raise Meenakshi as a brave warrior, just as he would a son, and that when she grew up and met her true love, her third breast would disappear[^2^]. Meenakshi proved herself gifted in battle, conquering armies in all directions[^2^]. When she sought to attack the north, however, she was confronted by the god Shiva, who dwells on Mount Kailasha, deep in the Himalayas[^2^]. Upon seeing him, one of her breasts fell off and the prophecy was realized[^2^]. Kumaraguruparar, a great seventeenth-century Tamil poet and devotee of Shiva, described this moment:

> When you saw Shiva on the battlefield, your third curving breast disappeared.
 You bowed to him shyly and were amazed to see that suddenly you had only two breasts[^2^].

Meenakshi and Shiva then married and ruled over Madurai as divine couple[^2^]. The temple is dedicated to their worship and celebrates their union every year in a grand festival called Chithirai Thiruvizha[^3^]. The temple is also known for its architectural splendor and artistic richness. It has twelve towering gateways called gopurams that are covered with thousands of colorful sculptures of gods, goddesses, demons and animals

The Meenakshi Temple is a prime example of Dravidian architectureâa style of Hindu architecture common in the southern states of India. Characteristics of Dravidian architecture often include covered porches on temples, tall entry gate towers on two or more sides, many-pillared halls, and a water tank or reservoir for ritual bathing[^4^] . The temple has twelve towering gateways called gopurams that are covered with thousands of colorful sculptures of gods, goddesses, demons and animals[^2^]. The gopurams range in height from 45 to 50 meters and are visible from a distance as landmarks of the city[^2^]. The tallest and oldest gopuram is the southern one, built by Maravarman Sundara Pandyan I in 1231 CE[^2^]. The temple also has several mandapas or halls that serve various functions such as assembly, marriage, music and festivals. Some of the notable mandapas are the Thousand Pillar Hall, which has 985 carved pillars and a museum of temple art; the Puthu Mandapam, which has exquisite sculptures and paintings; and the Ashta Shakthi Mandapam, which depicts the story of Meenakshi's birth and marriage[^2^]. The temple also has a sacred pool called Potramarai Kulam or the Golden Lotus Tank, where devotees take a dip before entering the main shrines[^2^].
 
The main shrines of the temple are dedicated to Meenakshi and Sundareswarar, who are enshrined in separate sanctums. The shrine of Meenakshi is located in the southwest corner of the temple complex, while the shrine of Sundareswarar is located in the center. Both shrines have a gold-plated vimana or tower over the sanctum. The shrine of Meenakshi is adorned with sculptures and paintings depicting her various aspects and legends. The sanctum contains a stone image of Meenakshi holding a parrot in her right hand and a bouquet of flowers in her left hand. She wears a green saree and a crown studded with gems. She is also known as Angayarkanni or the one with beautiful eyes shaped like a fish[^2^]. The shrine of Sundareswarar is simpler in design and decoration. The sanctum contains a lingam or aniconic representation of Shiva. He is also known as Somasundarar or the beautiful one with the crescent moon on his head[^2^]. The shrine also has a Nataraja hall where Shiva's cosmic dance is performed every evening by priests[^2^].
 
The Meenakshi Temple is not only a religious center but also a cultural hub of Madurai. It hosts various festivals throughout the year that attract thousands of pilgrims and tourists. The most important festival is the Chithirai Thiruvizha or the celestial wedding festival, which is celebrated in April-May. It commemorates the marriage of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar with elaborate rituals and processions. The festival lasts for 12 days and culminates with the coronation of Meenakshi as the queen of Madurai[^3^]. Other festivals include Navaratri, Cradle festival, Aavanimoolam, Meenakshi Tirukkalyaanam, Alagar's river plunge and many more[^2^]. The temple also supports various forms of art and music such as classical dance, Carnatic music, devotional songs and poetry. The temple has been patronized by various kings, poets, saints and artists over the centuries who have contributed to its glory and fame.
