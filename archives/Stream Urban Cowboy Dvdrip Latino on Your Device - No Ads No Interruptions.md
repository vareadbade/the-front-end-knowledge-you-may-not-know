If you are looking for a movie that combines romance, drama, music and rodeo, you might want to check out **Urban Cowboy**, a 1980 film starring John Travolta and Debra Winger. This movie tells the story of Bud Davis (Travolta), a young man who moves from his rural hometown to Houston, Texas, to work at an oil refinery. There, he meets Sissy (Winger), a feisty waitress who works at Gilley's Club, a popular country-western bar. They fall in love and get married, but their relationship is tested by their different personalities and expectations, as well as by the temptations of other people.
 
One of the main attractions of Gilley's Club is the mechanical bull, which Bud likes to ride to show off his skills. However, he does not allow Sissy to ride it, thinking that it is too dangerous for her. Sissy feels frustrated by Bud's macho attitude and decides to learn how to ride the bull with the help of Wes Hightower (Scott Glenn), a former convict and rodeo champion who works at the club. Wes has a hidden agenda: he wants to seduce Sissy and break up her marriage with Bud. As Bud and Sissy drift apart, they start seeing other people: Bud gets involved with Pam (Madolyn Smith), a wealthy heiress who offers him a more sophisticated lifestyle; and Sissy moves in with Wes, who becomes abusive and violent towards her.
