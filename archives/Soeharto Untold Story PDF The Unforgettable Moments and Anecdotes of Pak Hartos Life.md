Soeharto, the second president of Indonesia, is a figure who has been praised and criticized for his role in shaping the history of his country. He is often credited with bringing stability and economic development to Indonesia after the turmoil of the 1960s, but also accused of being a dictator who violated human rights and suppressed democracy. His life and legacy have been the subject of many books, but one of the most controversial ones is *Pak Harto: The Untold Stories*, a collection of anecdotes and memories from his family, friends, colleagues, and subordinates.
 
The book was published in 2007 by PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama, a leading publisher in Indonesia, and edited by Mahpudi, a journalist and former editor-in-chief of *Berita Yudha*, a military magazine. The book claims to reveal the "human side" of Soeharto, who was often seen as cold and aloof by the public. It contains stories about his childhood, his love for his wife Tien, his hobbies, his religious beliefs, his generosity, his compassion for animals, and his sense of humor. The book also attempts to defend Soeharto from some of the allegations against him, such as his involvement in the 1965 coup that led to the massacre of hundreds of thousands of alleged communists, his corruption and nepotism, and his responsibility for the human rights abuses in East Timor, Aceh, Papua, and other regions.

The book has received mixed reactions from readers and critics. Some praised it for showing a different perspective on Soeharto and for providing insights into his personality and leadership style. Others criticized it for being biased, uncritical, and lacking in historical evidence and scholarly rigor. Some even accused it of being a propaganda tool to whitewash Soeharto's image and to influence public opinion in favor of his family and political allies.

One of the most notable critics of the book is Robert Cribb, a professor of Indonesian history at Australian National University. In his review published in *The Journal of Asian Studies* in 2008[^1^], he revealed that the book was actually a slightly reworked version of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) intelligence report that was released in December 1968 with the title "Indonesia â 1965: The coup that backfired". Cribb argued that the book was not a new piece of scholarship at all, but rather a piece of propaganda intended to reinforce the Indonesian military's claim that the coup was "in every respect the planning of the PKI" (p. 265), the Indonesian Communist Party. He also pointed out that the book had no footnotes, bibliographical references, or sources to support its claims.
 
Cribb's review sparked a debate among scholars and journalists about the authenticity and reliability of the book. Some agreed with Cribb's analysis and condemned the book as a distortion of history. Others challenged Cribb's arguments and defended the book as a valuable contribution to understanding Soeharto's life and legacy. The debate also raised questions about the role and influence of the CIA in Indonesia's politics and history.
 
The book remains a controversial and contested source of information about Soeharto. It is available online as a PDF file[^2^], but it is not clear whether it has been officially authorized by the publisher or by Soeharto's family. It is also not clear whether it has been updated or revised since its first publication in 2007. The book may appeal to some readers who are curious about Soeharto's personal stories, but it should be read with caution and critical thinking.
