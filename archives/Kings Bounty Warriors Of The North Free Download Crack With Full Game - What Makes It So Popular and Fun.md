- Choose your class wisely. There are three classes to choose from: Skald, Soothsayer, and Warrior. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, as well as different skills and abilities. Skalds are good at buffing their troops and using runes, Soothsayers are good at casting spells and summoning creatures, and Warriors are good at dealing physical damage and using rage.
- Manage your army. You can recruit different types of units from various locations, such as villages, castles, or camps. Each unit has its own stats, abilities, and morale. You should balance your army according to your class, your enemies, and your budget. You should also upgrade your units whenever possible, as they will become stronger and gain new abilities.
- Explore the world. The game world is vast and full of secrets, treasures, quests, and enemies. You should explore every corner of the map, as you might find useful items, allies, or information. You should also complete as many quests as you can, as they will reward you with gold, experience, runes, or items.
- Use your valkyries. As you progress through the game, you will meet five valkyries who will join you as companions. Each valkyrie has her own personality, story, and quest. You should talk to them often, as they will give you useful advice, hints, or gifts. You should also complete their quests, as they will unlock their special abilities and improve their relationship with you.
- Cheat if you want to. If you find the game too hard or too easy, you can use cheat codes to modify it to your liking. To do so, press [Shift] + ~ in adventure mode to open the console window. Then type one of the following codes and press [Enter]:
