DelinvFile is a utility that allows you to delete data files that you have not been able to delete using the normal Windows Delete function[^3^]. You can use it to delete undeletable files and folders from your hard drive, USB drive, network drive, or any other storage device.
 
DelinvFile has a user-friendly interface that lets you navigate to the folder and select the file or folder to be deleted. You can choose from two delete methods: standard delete or delete at next boot. The latter option is useful for deleting locked files that are in use by another program.
 
DelinvFile also has a scan function that can identify file and folder names with invalid characters or too-long names that would make them un-removable via Windows Explorer[^3^]. You can then use DelinvFile to rename or delete these problematic names.
 
To use DelinvFile, you need a valid license key that you can purchase from the official website for $31.95 (USD). However, if you don't want to pay for it, you can try to find a keygen that can generate a serial key for you.
 
A keygen is a program that can create a unique code that can activate a software product. However, using a keygen is illegal and risky, as it may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.

- It has a clear and simple interface, which makes it easy to use for anyone.

DelinvFile is a handy tool that can help you get rid of those annoying files and folders that Windows Explorer cannot delete or rename. Whether they are corrupted, locked, or have invalid names, DelinvFile can deal with them in a few clicks. However, you should use it with caution, as deleting the wrong files or folders may cause system errors or data loss.
