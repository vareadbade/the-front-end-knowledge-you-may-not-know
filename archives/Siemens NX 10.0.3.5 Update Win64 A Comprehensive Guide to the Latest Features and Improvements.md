## New Features and Enhancements in Siemens NX 10.0.3.5 Update Win64
 
According to the official announcement from Siemens PLM Software, the Siemens NX 10.0.3.5 Update Win64 includes the following new features and enhancements:
 
- A new option to export a part file as a STEP AP242 file, which supports the exchange of product data between different CAD systems.
- A new command to create a sketch from a face or a plane, which simplifies the sketching process and reduces the number of steps required.
- A new option to display the minimum distance between two objects in the Measure Distance dialog box, which helps to check the clearance and interference between parts.
- A new option to automatically update the display of assembly components when they are modified in another session, which improves the performance and usability of large assemblies.
- A new option to specify the number of decimal places for dimensions in drawings, which allows more control over the precision and appearance of dimensions.
- A new option to hide or show all annotations in a drawing view, which helps to manage the clutter and visibility of annotations.
- A new option to create a section view along a spline curve, which enables more flexibility and creativity in creating section views.
- A new option to create a hole table from multiple views in a drawing, which saves time and effort in creating hole tables for complex parts.
- A new option to export a drawing as a PDF file with layers, which preserves the layer information and allows more control over the visibility of drawing elements.
- A new option to import a PDF file as an image in a drawing, which enables more flexibility and convenience in adding external images to drawings.
- A new option to create a thread feature from a helical edge or curve, which simplifies the creation of threaded features and reduces the number of steps required.
- A new option to create a swept feature along multiple guide curves, which enables more complex and organic shapes to be created with swept features.
- A new option to create a variable radius fillet along an edge or curve, which allows more control over the shape and size of fillets.
- A new option to create a blend feature between two faces with different topologies, which enables smoother transitions between faces with different numbers of edges or loops.
- A new option to create a draft feature from multiple faces or regions, which allows more flexibility and efficiency in creating draft features.
- A new option to create a shell feature from multiple faces or regions, which allows more flexibility and efficiency in creating shell features.
- A new option to create a pattern feature along multiple directions or curves, which enables more complex and varied patterns to be created with pattern features.
- A new option to create an associative array feature from multiple instances or components, which allows more control over the placement and orientation of array elements.
- A new option to create an associative mirror feature from multiple instances or components, which allows more control over the placement and orientation of mirror elements.
- A new option to create an associative move feature from multiple instances or components, which allows more control over the placement and orientation of move elements.
- A new option to create an associative scale feature from multiple instances or components, which allows more control over the placement and orientation of scale elements.
- A new option to create an associative rotate feature from multiple instances or components, which allows more control over the placement and orientation of rotate elements.
- A new option to create an associative copy feature from multiple instances or components, which allows more control over the placement and orientation of copy elements.
- A new command to edit multiple
