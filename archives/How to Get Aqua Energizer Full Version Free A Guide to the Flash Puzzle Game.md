## Aqua Energizer Tips and Tricks: How to Beat the Levels
 
Aqua Energizer is not an easy game, and some levels can be very frustrating. If you are stuck on a level or want to improve your score, here are some tips and tricks that might help you:
 
- Plan ahead. Before you start moving Nemo, look at the layout of the level and think of the best way to push the red balls to the energizer. Try to avoid pushing them into corners or dead ends, where you might not be able to get them out.
- Use the rocks wisely. The blue rocks can be useful for blocking enemies, creating paths, or crushing obstacles. However, they can also block your way or fall on top of you. Be careful when you dig under them or push them around.
- Watch out for enemies. The underwater world is full of dangers, such as sharks, piranhas, electric eels, mines, and lasers. Some enemies can be killed with rocks or red balls, while others can only be avoided. Learn their patterns and behaviors, and stay away from them as much as possible.
- Save your air. You have a limited amount of air in each level, which decreases as you move Nemo. You can replenish your air by collecting bubbles that appear randomly on the screen. However, don't waste time chasing bubbles if you don't need them. Try to complete each level as fast as you can.
- Use the level codes. If you complete a level, you will get a level code that allows you to start from that level again. You can also find level codes for both versions of the game online[^4^]. You can use these codes to skip levels that you find too hard or boring, or to replay levels that you want to improve your score on.
