The film is based on the real-life story of Hachiko, who was born in 1923 in Odate, Japan. He was adopted by Hidesaburo Ueno, a professor of agriculture at the Tokyo Imperial University. Ueno would commute to work by train every day, and Hachiko would accompany him to the Shibuya Station and wait for him to return. On May 21, 1925, Ueno died of a cerebral hemorrhage while giving a lecture. Hachiko did not know what had happened and continued to wait for him at the station every day until his own death on March 8, 1935.
 
Hachiko's loyalty and devotion touched the hearts of many people, especially the station workers and commuters who saw him every day. He became a national hero and a symbol of fidelity in Japan. In 1934, a bronze statue of Hachiko was erected at the Shibuya Station, with Ueno's former student Hirokichi Saito as the sculptor. Hachiko himself was present at the unveiling ceremony. The statue was melted down during World War II, but a new one was made in 1948 by Takeshi Ando, Saito's son. The statue still stands today and is a popular meeting spot for people in Tokyo.
 
Hachiko's story has been told in many books, films, and television shows around the world. The original Japanese film Hachiko Monogatari was released in 1987 and starred Tatsuya Nakadai as Ueno and Kaoru Yachigusa as his wife. The film was a critical and commercial success in Japan and won several awards, including the Japan Academy Prize for Best Film. The American remake Hachiko: A Dog's Story was released in 2009 and starred Richard Gere as Parker Wilson and Joan Allen as his wife Cate. The film was also well-received by audiences and critics, and won several awards, including the Truly Moving Picture Award at the Heartland Film Festival.
