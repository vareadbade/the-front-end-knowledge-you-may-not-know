Arabic calligraphy is not only a form of art, but also a reflection of the history and culture of the Islamic civilization. Arabic calligraphy has its roots in the 7th and 8th centuries CE, when the Arab followers of Muhammad conquered vast territories and spread the Arabic language and Islam. [^1^] Arabic became the official language of administration, religion, and learning, and the Arabic script was adapted to various vernaculars of the Islamic peoples. [^1^]
 
The earliest examples of Arabic calligraphy are inscriptions on stone and papyri. The Arabic script evolved from Nabataean, a dialect of Aramaic current in northern Arabia. [^1^] The script consists of 28 letters that are written from right to left. Some letters can be joined to their neighbours, while others cannot. The script also has different forms depending on the position of the letter in a word: initial, medial, final, or isolated. [^1^] [^2^]

The main tool used for Arabic calligraphy is the reed pen (qalam), which has a working point cut on an angle. This produces a thick downstroke and a thin upstroke with various gradations in between. The line traced by a skilled calligrapher is a marvel of fluidity and sensitivity, conveying the movement of the hand. [^1^] The calligrapher also uses ink, paper, and other materials to create different effects and styles.
 
Arabic calligraphy has developed many different scripts over time, each with its own characteristics and aesthetics. Some of the most popular scripts are Kufic, Naskh, Thuluth, Nasta'liq, and Diwani. Kufic is the oldest form of the Arabic script and was used for inscriptions on stone and metal. It is a square and angular script that is suitable for geometric designs. [^1^] [^2^] Naskh is a cursive script that was used for everyday purposes such as writing on papyrus and paper. It is a clear and legible script that became the basis for modern Arabic typography.
