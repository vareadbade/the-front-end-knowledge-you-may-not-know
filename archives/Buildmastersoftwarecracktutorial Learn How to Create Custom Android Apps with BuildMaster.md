## Step 1: Install BuildMaster
 
To get started with BuildMaster, you need to download and install it on your machine. You can get the latest version of BuildMaster from [here](https://inedo.com/buildmaster/download). The installation process is simple and straightforward. Just follow the instructions on the screen and choose the default options.
 
## Step 2: Create a New Application
 
Once you have installed BuildMaster, you can launch it from your Start menu or desktop shortcut. You will see the BuildMaster dashboard, where you can manage your applications and pipelines. To create a new application, click on the "Create Application" button on the top right corner of the dashboard. You will be asked to enter some basic information about your application, such as name, description, and icon. You can also choose a template for your application, which will pre-configure some settings and steps for you. For this tutorial, we will use the "ASP.NET Web Application" template.
 
## Step 3: Configure Your Pipeline
 
A pipeline is a series of steps that define how your application is built, tested, and deployed. BuildMaster provides a graphical interface for creating and editing pipelines. You can access your pipeline by clicking on the "Pipelines" tab on the left sidebar of your application page. You will see a default pipeline that consists of four stages: Development, Testing, Staging, and Production. Each stage has one or more actions that perform specific tasks, such as building your code, running tests, or deploying your application.
 
You can customize your pipeline by adding, removing, or modifying actions. For example, you can add a "Run Unit Tests" action to your Testing stage to run your unit tests using NUnit or MSTest. You can also change the order of actions by dragging and dropping them. To edit an action, simply click on it and adjust its settings on the right panel.
 
## Step 4: Trigger Your Pipeline
 
Now that you have configured your pipeline, you can trigger it manually or automatically. To trigger it manually, click on the "Execute" button on the top right corner of your pipeline page. You will be asked to select a stage to execute. For example, if you want to deploy your application to the Staging environment, select "Staging" from the dropdown menu. You will see a progress bar that shows the status of each action in your pipeline. You can also view the logs and artifacts of each action by clicking on them.
 
To trigger your pipeline automatically, you need to set up a trigger that monitors your source code repository for changes. BuildMaster supports various source control systems, such as Git, SVN, TFS, or Mercurial. To set up a trigger, click on the "Triggers" tab on the left sidebar of your application page. Then click on the "Create Trigger" button on the top right corner of the page. You will be asked to enter some information about your trigger, such as name, type, source control system, repository URL, branch name, etc. You can also specify when and how often to check for changes.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy Your Automated CI/CD Process
 
Congratulations! You have successfully created and deployed an ASP.NET application with BuildMaster. You can now enjoy the benefits of automated CI/CD process, such as faster delivery time, higher quality code, and reduced errors. You can also monitor and manage your applications and pipelines from the BuildMaster dashboard. You can view the status of each stage and action in your pipeline, as well as the history of previous executions. You can also create reports and notifications to keep track of your performance and issues.
