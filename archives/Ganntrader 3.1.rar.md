## What is Ganntrader 3.1?
  
Ganntrader 3.1 is a software program that was developed by Peter Pich and Billy Jones in the 1980s. It is based on the original writings and materials of W.D. Gann, who was a legendary trader and analyst in the early 20th century. Gann developed a unique system of technical analysis that combined mathematics, geometry, astrology, and cyclical patterns to forecast market movements and trends. He was able to profit from some of the most volatile market conditions in history, such as the Great Depression of 1929.
  
Ganntrader 3.1 is designed to help you study and apply Gann's techniques in a fast and accurate way. It is the only software program that includes all of the major Gann methods, such as:
  
- Geometric angles, such as the 1x1 angle that represents a balanced market
- Division of the range, which divides the price range into eighths or thirds
- 7 times the base, which projects future price levels based on a base number
- Squares of the high, low and range, which create dynamic support and resistance zones
- Natural squares of 52, 90, 120, 144 and 360, which are important time cycles
- Planet time cycles and aspects, which show the influence of planetary movements on market behavior
- Square of 9, which is a spiral chart that reveals hidden relationships between price and time

Ganntrader 3.1 also allows you to create swings and main trend indicators, mirror image foldbacks, zero angles, time and price displays, true trend lines, heliocentric and geocentric time cycles, average time cycles, high resolution chart printouts, custom chart paper creation, and more.
